# Multifactor_analysis_of_AQI_of_different_Indian_Cities
This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) focussed project. In this project, I analyse the AQI of different cities of India and present my findings through a report. I also use flask to create a simple interactive dashboard.

This project was completed as a part of the deliverables of the 'Data Analysis using Python' course taken up during my MBA program at IIM Shillong. In this project, we perform statistical analysis on the given data set and showcase our findings using various visualization tools available in Python. Using Flask, we create a simple interactive dashboard that depict some of the core findings.

Data is sourced from a public Kaggle dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india?select=city_day.csv

Please note that the codes used in the repository have been adopted from the codes shared by Prof. Dadabada as part of the 'Data Analysis using Python' course at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. The codes have been further modified to fit the appropriate use cases.
